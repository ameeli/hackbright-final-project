Wanda is a mindfulness tracker focused on improving a user's overall happiness and well-being.  It is inspired by a recent study by Harvard professor Daniel Gilbert, which revealed that humans mind-wander (think about something other than what they're doing) nearly half of the time, and  are significantly less happy when doing so.  Wanda reminds users to focus on the present and gathers mind wandering and happiness data through text surveys sent throughout the day. The data is then used to create charts for the user to visualize the impact that mind wandering has on happiness with the goal of decreasing this habit over time.
