Wanda is a wellness tool to increase your focus and happiness. Her creation was inspired by the study, "A Wandering Mind Is an Unhappy Mind", conducted by Dr. Daniel T. Gilbert during his tenure at Harvard University. In this study, mind wandering is defined as the act of thinkng about something other than what is currently happening. The results showed that people were significantly less happy when mindwandering, even if they were thinking about positive events.

This app reminds users to focus on the present throughout the day while keeping track of their mindwandering and happiness.
